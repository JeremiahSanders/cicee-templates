# Compose the project's artifacts, e.g., compiled binaries, Docker images.
#   This workflow performs all steps required to create the project's output.
#
#   This script expects a CICEE CI library environment (which is provided when using 'cicee lib exec').
#   For CI library environment details, see: https://github.com/JeremiahSanders/cicee/blob/main/docs/use/ci-library.md
#
#   Workflow:
#   - Publish an executable from src/library using 'Release' configuration.
#   - Pack a NuGet package from src/library using 'Release' configuration.
